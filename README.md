# Anthropic Quickstarts

Anthropic Quickstarts is a collection of projects designed to help developers quickly get started with building  applications using the Anthropic API. Each quickstart provides a foundation that you can easily build upon and customize for your specific needs.

## Getting Started
You wont need an API key. Rather you set it blank in all scenarios when prompted or when needed during revising/contributing.
So there are no pre-requisites. Just use LM STUDIO as backend api calling.
